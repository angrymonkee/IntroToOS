====== P3L6: Virtualization ======


=== What Is Virtualization ===

- Started in the 1960's
- Virtualization allows multiple OSs to be deployed on the same physical platform.
- Each OS thinks it "owns" its hardware
- Virtual Machine â€” OS and Applications

=== Defining Virtualization ===

Virtual Machine: efficient, isolated, duplicate of the real machine, supported by a virtual machine monitor (VMM)

Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM)
1. Provides essentially identical environment as the original machine
2. At worst only minor decrease in speed
3. In complete control of the system resources

=== Benefits of Virtualization ===

**Consolidation** - running multiple machines on a single physical machine
	- Decrease cost
	- Improve manageability of the system
**Migration** - 
	- Availability - create new VMs whenever needed
	- Reliability - When hardware fails migration can occur to new machine
**Security**
**Debugging**
**Support for Legacy OSs**

=== Two Main Virtualization Models ===
**Bare-Metal or Hypervisor-Based (Type1)**
**Hosted (Type2)**

=== Virtualization Models Bare Metal ===

VMM (Hypervisor)
Service VM with hightened privilages to deal with devices

{{./screenshot_2015-12-05-213919.png}}

Xen (Hypervisor)
	- dom0 - Service VM
	- domUs - Guest VMs
	- drivers run in dom0

ESX (VMWare)

=== Virtualization Models Hosted ===

{{./screenshot_2015-12-05-214346.png}}

KVM - based on linux system
QEMU - Emulator used to emulate hardware devices, only interveins certain critical instructions when it needs to pass control to the host OS.

=== Hardware Supported Protection Levels ===

Native Model
Ring 0: OS highest priviledge
Ring 3: lowest priviledge application

{{./screenshot_2015-12-05-215301.png}}

Virtualization Approach
Ring 0: Hypervisor
Ring 1: OS
Ring 3: Applications

More Recent x86 Models (root vs non-root mode)

=== Processor Virtualization ===

=== x86 Virtualization in the Past ===

=== Binary Translation ===

{{./screenshot_2015-12-05-220305.png}}

Binary translation
	- **Full Virtualization**: Run unmodified guest OS
	- Dynamic binary translation

=== Paravirtualization ===

{{./screenshot_2015-12-05-220901.png}}

{{./screenshot_2015-12-05-221005.png}}


=== Memory Virtualization Full ===

**** All guest OSs should see a contiguous physical memory starting at zero**

{{./screenshot_2015-12-05-221413.png}}


=== Memory Virtualization Paravirtualized ===

**** Guest OS is aware of virtualization so can modify the guest OS**

=== Device Virtualization ===

{{./screenshot_2015-12-05-221902.png}}


=== Passthrough Model ===

Guest VM as access to the hardware directly and by-passes the VMM

{{./screenshot_2015-12-05-222210.png}}


=== Hypervisor Direct Model ===

Hypervisor intercepts every device access from the guest VM

{{./screenshot_2015-12-05-222357.png}}

{{./screenshot_2015-12-05-222436.png}}


=== Split Device Driver Model ===

All device access control is split between front-end driver and back-end driver in service VM

{{./screenshot_2015-12-05-222914.png}}


=== Hardware Virtualization ===
